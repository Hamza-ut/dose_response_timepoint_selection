# dose_response_timepoint
## using mean abs diff and SNR ratios to select best timepoint for drc modelling
#### Test1: uses standardized raw response and find best timepoint using mean diff (variance) b.w response values
#### Test2: uses signal to noise ratio to identify best timepoint
#### Test3: composite score, it calculates signal to noise ratio, dose_response_correlation variance and dynamic range
