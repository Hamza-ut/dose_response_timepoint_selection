# Concentration-Response Curve

For in vitro assays (cell or enzyme assays), the process remains the same but with some different jargon.

## Key Terms

| Term | Variable Type | Meaning |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Concentration | Independent (x) | Drug/compound amount in well (µM, nM) |
| Response | Dependent (y) | Cell or enzyme activity (%) |
| EC₅₀ / IC₅₀ | Parameter | Concentration for 50% effect (potency) |
| Emax / Emin | Parameter | Max/min achievable response (efficacy) |
| Hill Slope | Parameter | Curve steepness (sensitivity/cooperativity) |
| Selectivity Index | Derived ratio | Safety margin between target and non-target cells |

## 1. Concentration

The amount of drug or compound you add to your cell or enzyme assay, usually expressed in micromolar (µM) or nanomolar (nM). It is the **independent variable (x-axis)** in your dose-response curve.

## 2. Response

The biological activity you measure from the cells or enzymes, such as % cell viability, enzyme activity, or receptor activation. It is the **dependent variable (y-axis)**.

## 3. EC₅₀ (Effective Concentration 50%)

- This is the concentration of your drug that produces 50% of the maximum possible response.
- It is a measure of potency, telling us how much drug is needed to produce a half-maximal effect.
- Lower EC₅₀ means higher potency — less drug is needed.

## 4. IC₅₀ (Inhibitory Concentration 50%)

- Similar to EC₅₀ but used when the drug inhibits a process.
- It is the concentration that causes 50% inhibition of activity.
- Used for inhibitors or blockers.

## 5. Emax and Emin

- **Emax** is the maximum effect (response) a drug can produce — indicates efficacy.
- **Emin** is the minimum effect (often baseline or no drug).

## 6. Hill Slope

- Describes the **steepness** of the dose-response curve.
- Indicates how sharply the response changes with concentration.
- A steep slope means that a small concentration change produces a big response change, which can indicate cooperative binding or sensitivity.

## 7. Selectivity Index

This measures the **safety margin** of a drug between different cell types.

**Formula:**
```
SI = IC₅₀ in non-target cells / IC₅₀ in target cells
```

- A higher selectivity index means the drug is safer — it affects target cells at much lower concentrations than non-target cells.

## Quick Reference

- **Low EC₅₀ / IC₅₀**: Potent (strong effect at low concentration)
- **High EC₅₀ / IC₅₀**: Weak (needs more compound for same effect)

A 96‑well plate has 8 rows (A–H) and 12 columns (1–12). Each small box below is a well; each well can contain a different treatment.
Columns →  1    2    3    4   ...  12
Row A   | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 | ... | A12 |
Row B   | B1 | B2 | B3 | B4 | ... | B12 |
